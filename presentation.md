## Task 1

# Dataset 
We used the POP909 dataset for this assignment. This dataset contains the piano arrangements of 909 pop songs created by professional musicians. Each song is available in midi format, and has several versions saved in the same folder.

# Modeling 
For Task 1, we started off with a Markov chain.

- cons 

Then, we decided to use the RNN.
